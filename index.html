<h1> Living and Loving</h1>


<p>Living life through this pandemic has been a challenge for everyone. Through all the craziness, my children and I have found some peace in our walks along the river. Sometimes though, we will take a drive (especially on cold days). Let's face it, the craziness from news stories, social media drama, the great toilet tissue issues, the fear and unknown is enough to make anyone feel a little crazy. It is so nice to just get away from it all with a stroll with mother nature. With that, we give thanks to her beauty and tranquility she has to offer by bringing us an opportunity for peace and bringing our being back to balance with beautiful earth, fresh air, and clean water.</p>

<h2> My favorite things to snack on, that I never have enough of... include:</h2>
<ol>
  <li> Smoked salmon</li>
  <li>fried bread</li>
  <li>blackberry jam</li>
  <li>coffee</li>
  <li>chocolate chip cookies </li>
</ol>

<p>I think it is safe to say that throughout all this craziness, a lot of us eat....and eat, and eat, AND EAT! lol and that is okay. I've heard plenty of stories about how many of my friends and family have never snacked so much in their lives. I believe it. I| am guilty, myself for over stocking the snack cupboard with more junk food "just in case", which includes chips (which I eat by the bag full), cookies, fruit roll-ups and all the other things my parents never bought growing lol. The first step to making change is admitting it......</p>

<h3>Making A Change.....& Making My Own Cup of Coffee</h3>

<p> One of the biggest changes I have made is making my own coffee. I order a large 1 cream, 2 sugar from McDonalds. This is my choice of morning brew and let me tell you something, making my own coffee has made me realize how much cream and sugar actually goes into my giant cup of coffee....but it tastes sooooo goooood once it hits your lips and seeps into your soul with it's deliciousness. mmmm.....coffee (insert homer drool face here) </p>



<h1> Please take a moment to say a little prayer for everyone that has tested positive for COVID-19 </h1>

<p> I know we hear enough about it through the news and it doesn't really have an affect on you the same way unless you've gone through it or it hits close to home. But if you could just please take a moment of silence to think about and say a little prayer in your own way for those that have been directly impacted by COVID-19. Thank you. </p>
